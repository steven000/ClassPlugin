[ClassPlugin](https://github.com/steven000/ClassPlugin) is a flexible class replacement plugin for gradle, 
the `ClassPlugin` can be used to replace the class of the jar which contained in both the libs and the gradle dependency.
if you encounter some bugs on the third-party jars, the `ClassPlugin` will be the best way to solve it.

## Installation
To use `ClassPlugin` in a `module`, add the plugin to your `buildscript`:

```gradle
    buildscript {
        repositories {
            maven {
               url "https://dl.bintray.com/wuwen/maven"
            }
        }
    
        dependencies {
            classpath 'com.wuwen.gradleplugin:classreplace:1.0.0'
        }
    }
```

And then apply it in your `module`:

``` gradle 
    apply plugin: 'com.wuwen.classreplace'
``` 

Last config the `classreplace` Extension

``` gradle 
    classreplace {
        sourceType 'class' 
        configFiles file('src/classreplace/class-replace-config.txt')
    }
```  

## Config Files
The format of the config file
``` txt
    ${source class path}:${target class path}
``` 

**${source class path}:** The relative classpath based on the current project is used to replace $ {target class path}<br/>
**${target class path}:** The jar entry name of the class which you are replaced with the ${source class path}

# How to generate source class 

* New the `package name` same as the `target class` that you are replaced  
* New the `java class` same as the `target class` that you are replaced
* Copy the `target class` content to the new `java class`
* Do some changes
* Build the `module` or the `project`  
* Find the generated class on the path: build/intermediates/classes/{package name}/{class name}
